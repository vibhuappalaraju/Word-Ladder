# Word-Ladder

A world ladder program using Breadth first search(BFS) and Depth first search(DFS).

The word ladder programs takes in two words as inputs(the first followed by a space and then the second word).The first word will be the start word and the second word will be the end word. The program then must change the start word to the end step by step. Each step must be a valid word in the dictionary provided in the five_letter_words.txt.Each step must have a single letter substitued of the word before it. For example, (Cold -> Cord). If the first word can progressively turn into the second word, the list or the word ladder will be displayed. If there is no word ladder between the two words then a message will appear stating there does not exist a word ladder.
